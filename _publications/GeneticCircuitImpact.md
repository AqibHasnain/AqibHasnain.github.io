We show how Koopman operators can be used to quantify impact on genetic circuits. We consider an experimental example, using high-throughput RNAseq measurements collected from wild-type E. coli, single gate components transformed in E. coli, and a NAND circuit composed from individual gates in E. coli, to explore how Koopman subspace functions encode increasing circuit interference on E. coli chassis dynamics.
